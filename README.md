# pi-extensions

Personal extensions for [pi coding agent](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).

## Install

```bash
./install.sh
```

Copies all `extensions/*.ts` to `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`.

---

## extensions/subagent.ts

Spawn subagents with isolated context. The LLM can delegate tasks to other models.

- Single or parallel execution (up to 8 tasks, 4 concurrent)
- Uses scoped models from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`
- Supports tool restrictions per subagent
- Streams progress and tracks usage/cost
- Model skills annotations help pick the right model

### Model Skills

Define model capabilities in `~/.pi/agent/model-skills/*.md`:

```markdown
# ~/.pi/agent/model-skills/claude-sonnet.md
---
model: claude-sonnet
for: tool use, coding, fast execution
weaknesses: complex abstract reasoning
abstract: 6
detailed: 7
tool-use: 9
instruction: 8
creativity: 6
speed: 8
cost: 7
context: 7
---
```

**Fields:**
- `model`: substring to match (longest match wins)
- `for`: short description of strengths
- `weaknesses`: optional limitations
- Ratings (1-10, higher is better):
  - `abstract`: big-picture thinking, architectural reasoning
  - `detailed`: step-by-step logic, edge cases, debugging
  - `tool-use`: reliable multi-step file/code operations
  - `instruction`: follows instructions precisely
  - `creativity`: novel approaches, writing quality
  - `speed`: response time
  - `cost`: cost efficiency (higher = cheaper)
  - `context`: context window size

The tool description shows an XML schema with all axes defined, helping the orchestrating agent pick the right model for each task.

### Usage

**Via LLM tool call:**
```
Single: { model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5", task: "..." }
Parallel: { tasks: [{ model: "...", task: "..." }, ...] }
```

**Via slash command:**
```
/subagent claude-sonnet review this PR
```

### Rendering

- Collapsed view shows output preview (5 lines)
- Expanded view (Ctrl+O) shows task, tool calls, full output
- Status icons: ✓ success, ✗ error, ⏳ running, ◐ partial

## extensions/per-model-system-prompt.ts

Per-model system prompts. Different models get different instructions.

### Why?

Different models need different prompting:
- Claude works well with XML tags and `<thinking>` blocks
- GPT models may need more explicit guardrails
- Some models have bad habits that need specific "NEVER do X" rules

### Usage

Create files in `.pi/` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/` (global):

```
~/.pi/agent/
├── SYSTEM.claude.md         # Replaces base prompt for Claude
├── SYSTEM.gpt.md            # Replaces base prompt for GPT
├── APPEND_SYSTEM.claude.md  # Appends to prompt for Claude
└── APPEND_SYSTEM.gpt.md     # Appends to prompt for GPT
```

### Example files

**SYSTEM.claude.md** (replaces entire base prompt):
```markdown
You are an expert coding assistant optimized for Claude.

Use XML tags for structured output.
Think step-by-step in <thinking> blocks before complex operations.

NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` - always add specific files.
```

**APPEND_SYSTEM.gpt.md** (adds to existing prompt):
```markdown
## GPT-specific Guidelines

NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .` - always add specific files.
NEVER run destructive commands without confirmation.
Always read files before editing.
```

### How it works

**Model family detection:**
- Substring match in model ID
- `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` → matches `claude`
- `openrouter/openai/gpt-4o` → matches `gpt`
- Longest match wins: `claude-sonnet` beats `claude`

**SYSTEM.md resolution** (first match wins, replaces base):
1. `.pi/SYSTEM.<family>.md`
2. `.pi/SYSTEM.md`
3. `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.<family>.md`
4. `~/.pi/agent/SYSTEM.md`
5. Built-in default

**APPEND_SYSTEM.md resolution** (additive, all concatenated):
1. `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (if exists)
2. `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.<family>.md` (if exists)
3. `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` (if exists)
4. `~/.pi/agent/APPEND_SYSTEM.<family>.md` (if exists)

### Status bar

Shows which prompt file is active: `📝 SYSTEM.claude.md +1 append`

## extensions/taskman-compaction.ts

Replaces auto-compaction with taskman handoff format.

### Why?

Default compaction uses a rigid structured format. This extension:
- Uses the `/handoff` skill for compaction summaries
- Produces breadcrumbs (pointers) instead of copying content
- Integrates with taskman context (STATUS.md, MEDIUMTERM_MEM.md)
- Keeps summaries lean with progressive disclosure

### Usage

Add to `~/.pi/settings.jsonl`:
```json
{"extensions": ["~/pi-extensions/extensions/taskman-compaction.ts"]}
```

### Settings

All settings go in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (global) or `.pi/settings.json` (project).

**Earlier compaction** — default triggers at ~92% context. To trigger earlier (~70%):
```json
{"compaction": {"reserveTokens": 60000}}
```

**Mid-turn compaction threshold** — during long tool-use turns, the framework only checks context size after the entire turn. This extension also checks after each LLM call and triggers compaction early when tokens exceed the threshold. Default is 160K (matches 200K context window with 40K reserve):
```json
{"compaction": {"midTurnTokenThreshold": 160000}}
```

### Requirements

Requires `taskmanager-exe` installed:

```bash
pipx install taskmanager-exe
taskman install-skills
```

This provides the handoff skill at `~/.pi/agent/skills/taskman/handoff.md`.
